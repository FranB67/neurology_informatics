      Lookup model that lists all neurology outpatient services.

      There are several limitations to this approach but this model provides the basis for further refinement of how this data is captured within the EPR.

      ## List of limitations:

      ## Alternative approaches:

      - Use a seed file with curated list of neurology outpatient services

  - name: lkup__provider
    description: >
      Lookup model that lists all neurology providers (consultants, specialist nurses, etc.)

      There are several limitations to this approach but this model provides the basis for further refinement of how this data is captured within the EPR.

      ## List of limitations:
      
      - Non-neurology consultants assigned to neurology or vice versa

      ## Alternative approaches:

      - Use a seed file with curated list of neurology providers

    columns: []

  - name: stg__visit_occurrence_outpatients
    description: >
      All visits to neurology outpatients during the study window for clinic visits.
  
  - name: stg__condition_occurrence
    description: >
      All conditions recorded at _any_ time for patients who had at least one neurology outpatient visit.

  - name: stg__condition_era
    description: >
      All conditions recorded at _any_ time for patients who had at least one neurology outpatient visit.
      This model uses the `condition_era` table instead of the `condition_occurrence` table.
  - name: stg__distinct_patients
    description: >
      Distinct list of patients who had at least one neurology outpatient visit.
